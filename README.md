# Paystack-Integration-Using-Java
The examples provided are based on my experience while having to integrate paystack’s e-payment gateway in a few of my web  projects.

I first of all assume that you done the following:
Created a paystack account from https://paystack.com 
You have been able to access your paystack , test public and private keys located in your settings, under API Keys & Webhooks
You have a basic understanding of the aforementioned web building technologies.
